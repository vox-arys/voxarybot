# VoxaryBot
twitch utility bot with a modular command system.

# Setup
the bot requires minimal setup, without that it won´t work.
1. download the newest version from releases and save it somewhere where it´s "alone" in it´s folder.
2. run setup.exe and follow the instructions
3. go to your twitch chat and send "/mod voxarybot"
4. whenever you´re ready to stream, just run bot.exe. you should see a message from the bot in your chat.
#
note: the bot is set up to automatically shoutout raiders, but this functionality works based on the incoming raid response by streamelements. if streamelements isn´t set up, then auto-shoutouts will not work.

note 2: this bot is NOT a chat moderation bot. it will do absolutely nothing against anyone.
